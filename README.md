# Spell Tweaks.

This mod is a collection of spell tweaks for spells of the [Spell Revisions](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/SpellRevisions), which, obviously enough, is a requirement.

# Installation.

The mod is a standard WeiDU mod. copy the main folder to the BG install folder (the one containing the chitin.key file). Assuming WeiDU is installed and the executables `weinstall` and `weidu` are in the path, open a command line and do

```
weinstall spell_tweaks
```

Then what components to install.

note(s):

* See [A New Playerâ€™s Guide to Installing and Playing Mods](https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/33164-a-new-player%E2%80%99s-guide-to-installing-and-playing-mods) for a beginner's tutorial on modding BG2.

## A. Standardized Summoning.

This tweak standardizes duration of SR summons, both Wizard's Monster Summoning and Druid's Animal Summoning, to 5 turns. In SR they have a duration of 2 to 3 turns so this tweak increases the time they stay around.

note(s):
* Requires main component of [Spell Revisions](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/SpellRevisions).

## B. Non-combat Triggers and Contingencies.

This tweak sets the non-combat flag on all trigger and contingency spells, so that you can no longer cast them mid-combat. This will stop some of the more egregious douchebaggery, especially in the case of Sorcerers and Chain Contingency.
